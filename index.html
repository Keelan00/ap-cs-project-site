        <p>
          For the AP final project, my partner and I worked together to create a Stats Calculator Python app. 
          It can calculte the mean, median, Q1, and Q3 of any list of numbers. This was a great way to use lists in Python as well as breaking the program into functions. 
          Although it was a bit stressfull getting it finished on time, I still had a lot of fun working on it and working with my partner to find and fix bugs.

        </p>
        <p>
          For my genius hour I learned how to use Python to interact with XML and CSV. 
          I then used this knowledge to create a script to find a user's points within a XML file and write them to a CSV file. 
          The XML files are parsed using the xml.etree.ElementTree module and written using the csv module.

          In this project my partner and I used micropython to program a neopixel connected to a Pi Pico. It was fun to program and test the Pi using Thonny. You can test it on the link above.

        </p>
        <p>
          The goal of this project was to create an “App” in Snap! that can draw
          using the user's mouse in many colors and sizes. Also there was the
          additional challenge of adding menus for click and draw
          shapes. My favorite part was realizing I could use multiple variables
          as “on and off” switches for selecting a shape. I also used variables
          for color, pen size, shape size, and more! For the buttons I used images
          that run function once they are clicked.

        <p>
          I have always enjoyed using QR codes to easily open the same tab from my computer on my phone or vice versa. The problem is many QR code sites are covered in ads which makes them a pain to use! From looking at how others have made QR code generators online I was able to create this tool with some help from a friend. The hardest part was understanding how others had used JavaScript since I have minimal experience in the language.

        <p>
          This project uses python to check if the number a user enters is odd or even. It does this by checking if the number can be divided by two without a remainder. If it can, the number is determined even, otherwise the number is odd. This shows how well math works in the python language.
