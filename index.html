          The goal of this project was to create an “App” in Snap! that can draw
          using the user's mouse in many colors and sizes. Also there was the
          additional challenge of adding menus for selection of click and draw
          shapes. My favorite part was realizing I could use multiple variables
          as “on and off” switches for selecting a shape. I also used variables
          for color, pen size, shape size, and more! For buttons I used images
          with code running once they are clicked.

        <p>
          I have always enjoyed using QR codes to easily open the same tab from my computer on my phone or vice versa. The problem is many QR code sites are covered in ads which makes them a pain to use! From looking at how others have made QR code generators online I was able to create this tool with some help from a friend. The hardest part was understanding how others had used JavaScript since I have minimal experience in the language.
